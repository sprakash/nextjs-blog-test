[Next.js] project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`] it makes an API request to Blogger API to get blog posts to display. Clicking on each post will take the user to individual post pages. 

These pages are rendered using the Next.js getStaticProps and getStaticPaths. 

All the css in this project is using TailwindCSS. No other css is used, therefore, no .css files or inline styles.

To run the project 

you will need a .env that holds a API_KEY from Google for BloggerAPI

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
